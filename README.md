# System Application for Contact Management

## Description
This repository contains a system application that interacts with the terminal of a device. The application is designed to write to and read from a file, specifically handling data such as names, contact numbers, and email addresses.

## Features
- **Data Input**: The application allows users to input data such as names, contact numbers, and email addresses directly from the terminal.
- **Data Storage**: The application writes the input data to a file for persistent storage.
- **Data Retrieval**: The application can read the stored data from the file and display it in the terminal.

## Future Updates
In future releases, we plan to add an encryption feature to enhance the security of the stored data. This means that the data written to the file will be encrypted, and only decrypted when read from the file.

## Installation and Usage
Instructions for installation and usage will be provided soon.
